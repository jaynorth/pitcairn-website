      <dd > <p>Today's Pitcairn Island population is descended from British sailors and Tahitians.  
        The mutineers of the <strong>HMS Bounty</strong> settled the island [first discovered by world explorers on 2 July 1767 by midshipman 
        Pitcairn aboard the HMS Swallow] in 1790, 
        along with their Tahitian women and a few Tahitian men.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Fletcher Christian</strong> and his band of mutineers seized the Bounty from <strong>Captain William Bligh</strong> on 28 April 1789 following 
        a voyage filled with disrespect and frequent, sometimes severe, punishments from Bligh toward his crew. </p>
      <dd class="ddIMGleft"><img src="Images_mod/breadfruit.jpg" alt="breadfruit" width="410" height="240"  /><br />

      <dd class="ddPright"> <em> The Bounty set sail from Spithead in Portsmouth, England on 23 December 1787 on a mission to gather 
        breadfruit trees from Polynesia and transport them to the British West Indies.  
        The intent was to provide a new food source for the workers on sugar plantations there. 
        
        After ten months and 27 thousand miles 
        of sailing, the Bounty arrived 
        in Mataivai Bay, Tahiti (where it remained until 4 April 1789); here the crew spent several months 
        cultivating young breadfruit trees 
        and prepared them for transport to their new destination. </em> </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat" > During their long stay in Tahiti, many of the men became involved with 
        local women and some married.  When it was time to leave this island paradise, they had a difficult 
        time parting – this undoubtedly contributed 
        to the motivation toward the soon coming mutiny. </dd>
      <dd class="ddIMGcenter"><img src="Images_mod/mutiny.jpg" alt="mutiny"  width="550" /><br />
        Painting of the mutiny</dd>
      <dd class="ddPleft">
        <p> Following the mutiny, Captain Bligh and eighteen loyal crew members were set adrift in a longboat 
          and eventually arrived in 
          Indonesia after an incredible open boat voyage of several thousand miles. </p>
        <p>Fletcher and his men returned to Tahiti for their 
          women, and to discharge sixteen loyalists and mutineers who did not want to continue with him; then 
          they circled the South Pacific 
          for several months looking for a safe place to hide from the inevitable hunt to find and prosecute them.</p>

        Arriving at Pitcairn</dd>
      <dd class="ddPright">
        <p> They eventually 
          chose Pitcairn Island and arrived on 15 January 1790; they realized it was originally charted incorrectly
          by about 200 miles, thus making 
          them less likely to be found by future voyagers. 
          Deciding to stay on the isolated island, the nine remaining mutineers, their women 
          some nine other Polynesian men and women, unloaded and stripped the ship, then on 23 January set 
          the Bounty afire so as to hide all evidence 
          of their whereabouts ... hence, they quickly became, and remain, one of the world's most isolated communities. </p>
      </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat">
        <p> After a period of four years, the community fell into turmoil.  Fueled by homemade alcohol, disputes 
          over women eventually 
          resulted in the violent deaths of all but two of the men, <strong>John Adams</strong> and <strong>Edward Young</strong> . </p>
      <dd class="ddIMGleft"><img src="Images_mod/adams.jpg" alt="John Adams" width="300" height="340" /><br />
        John Adams</dd>
      <dd class="ddPright">
        <p> Six years later 
          Young died of asthma; Adams was left with eleven 
          women and 23 children.  Adams turned to the Bounty Bible, which led him to repentance and a new outlook 
          on life.  Using the Bible, he 
          educated the children, built a school and organized the community into a Christian way of life. </p>
        <p> In 1808 Pitcairn was re-discovered by the American ship Topaz.  Reports of the find went largely ignored; 
          then, on 17 September 1814 the island
          community was again accidentally 'discovered' by two British frigates.  Surprised by their 
          find and impressed by the character of the residents, they 
          chose to leave this community, founded by mutineers, alone and allow Adams to remain with his
          people. </p>
      </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat">
        <p>Adams died on 6 March 1829 at age 63, forty-two years 
          after the Bounty set sail on its fateful voyage.  A varied succession of leadership followed 
          until an orderly government was established in 1893.</p>

        Painting of Fletcher Christian</dd>
      <dd class="ddPleft">
        <p><em>Earlier, the Bounty crew remaining in Tahiti was found by the HMS Pandora, which was sent out to 
          find and bring the mutineers to trial in England.  
          All were found – some were acquitted and some were hanged.  The ultimate fate of <strong>Fletcher 
          Christian</strong> was never documented; it is said he was seen 
          in England in later years, but it is generally believed he was killed, along with his companions, 
          during the bloody years of the community's history.</em></p>
      </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat"> The present civilization of Pitcairn descends from these nine mutineers and their Tahitian women. None of 
        the Tahitian men fathered any children on Pitcairn.  
        The Bounty settlers established their small community, which subsisted for more than forty years until a visiting 
        captain, fearing for the inhabitants' well-being, relocated the population to Tahiti (1831), where they soon 
        succumbed to diseases that were foreign to them, as well as homesickness. Substantially reduced in numbers and 
        longing for the familiarity of Pitcairn, they returned to their beloved home, where the population rebounded and 
        surpassed its previous number. </dd>
      <dd class="ddPright">
        <p> In little more than two decades, due to over population, the residents were once 
          again relocated, this time to Norfolk Island (1856), in a move that was thought to improve their quality of life 
          and ease of management.<br />
          As with the first relocation attempt, homesickness prevailed and, before too much time 
          passed by, an intrepid group of determined Pitcairners made the decision to return to their beloved island, to be 
          followed soon after by others who could not stay away. Pitcairn has remained constantly inhabited ever since. </p>

        Norfolk Island</dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat"> Prior to its discovery by Carteret and the subsequent settlement by the Bounty mutineers, Pitcairn Island was 
        known as 'Mata-ki-te-Rangi' or 'Heragi,' according to  Mangarevan folklore.  It is clear from existing artifacts 
        that Pitcairn played an integral role in ancient Polynesian history of the southern-most part of the Tuamotu 
        Archipelago. The island may have been an important source of stone tools for that region of the Pacific.  
        Pitcairn was surely occupied by those peoples for a significant period of their history, as evidenced by 
        ancient maraes and stone gods. </dd>
        <dd><p>
        To this day, descendants of the Bounty mutineers still live on the island and the current population is around 56.
