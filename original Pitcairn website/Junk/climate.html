    	<h2>Climate</h2>
	<p>Pitcairn enjoys an equitable climate, with mean monthly temperatures varying from 19째 C in August to 24째 C 
    in February. Daily temperatures can vary from 13째 C to 33째 C. The 2,000 mm of annual rainfall is 
    unevenly distributed, and prolonged rainy periods alternate with droughts. Moderate easterly winds 
    predominate with short east-to-southeast gales occurring between April and September.</p>
    <p>
	The Pitcairn Islands have the lowest population figure in the world. The Pitcairn Islands get about 
    1,670 millimeters of annual precipitation on average. In combination with the pleasant subtropical 
    climate the climate conditions are very beneficial for plant and animal life on the fertile volcanic 
    soil. Because of low population figures (50 registered inhabitants in 2008) the balance between man 
    and nature is excellent. If you would like to visit the Pitcairn Islands you should bear in mind that
     you'll have to make a long trip. Because the islands have no airport the only way of reaching them 
     is by boat. </p>
     <p>
The Pitcairn Islands have a warm maritime climate with precipitation all year round and only few differences 
in average temperatures between the months. However, in absolute temperatures differences may be larger. 
During the local summer (December till March) temperatures may rise above 30 degrees Celsius. During the 
winter temperatures may drop to just above 10 degrees Celsius. The Pitcairn Islands are situated in a zone
 in the Pacific where hurricanes form. This means there is always a (small) risk that a typhoon or tropical
  depression hits the islands.
