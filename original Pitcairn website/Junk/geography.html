    <h2>Geography</h2>
	<p>Pitcairn Island, more than 2,200 km southeast of Tahiti, sits alone between Peru and New Zealand 
    at 25° south latitude and 130° west longitude. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Mangareva, a small 
    island in French Polynesia 490 km to the northwest. Easter Island lies 1,900 km to the east.</p>
	<p>A high volcanic island, Pitcairn reaches 347 meters at the Pawala Ridge and is bounded by rocks 
    and high cliffs on all sides. There's no coral reef, and breakers roll right in to the shore. The island 
    is only 4.5 square km, almost half of which is fertile ground and well suited for human habitation.</p>
	<p>The uninhabited "nearby" islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno belong to Pitcairn.
     The tiny colony controls an exclusive economic zone of 800,000 square km, an important reason why Britain
     is in no hurry to leave.</p>
