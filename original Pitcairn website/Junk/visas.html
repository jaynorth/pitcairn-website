 <p>
 If your visit is for 14 days or less and you intend to arrive and depart on the same vessel, you may 
 apply for leave to enter on arrival at Pitcairn.  There is no need for prior entry clearance.  
 But you must ensure you can adequately maintain and accommodate yourself without recourse to public
  funds and meet the other criteria in Part III Para 6 of the Immigration Ordinance 2006.
 </p>
<p>
If your visit is for longer than 14 days but less than 6 months you must 
complete an entry clearance application form well in advance of your visit 
(at least 3 months is recommended).  The application form should be submitted electronically 
to the Pitcairn Immigration Officer on immigration@pitcairn.gov.pn and copied to the Pitcairn 
Islands Office on admin@pitcairn.gov.pn.  If you do not get an acknowledgement 
within 2 weeks, telephone on (649) 366 0186 to confirm your application has been received.
</p>
<p>
If your visit is for professional or business reasons, you should
 follow the same visa application procedure but the conditions for any visit to 
 the island will be as described in Part III Para 8 of the Immigration Ordinance 2006.
