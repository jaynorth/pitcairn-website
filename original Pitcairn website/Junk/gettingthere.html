	<p>First, the way to got there is via the SV Xplore; which is a 20-meter yacht run by a really nice and experienced Australian skipper and chartered by Pitcairn Travel itself to the island. It has a capacity of 8 passengers on the boat. The speed will be about 6-9 knots depending on the winds and weather. It will be bumpy but will also be relaxing assuming decent weather and no seasickness. The cost including the expensive 4-hour flights to and from Mangareva from Pape'ete, a hotel and transfers on each; plus room and board on Pitcairn is about $4500 for a one-week trip (3 days on the island) and shockingly only $5000 for 2 weeks. 2 weeks includes 10 days on Pitcairn. Book this through Jacqui Christian at Pitcairn Travel.

    <p>Second, you can take the MV Claymore II from Mangareva as well. This is a motor vessel that acts as a supply ship to Pitcairn Island and runs about four times a year at a cost of NZ$5000. The speed is faster than the Xplore.</p>

    <p>Third, a handful of trans-Pacific cruise ships will try to anchor off the coast of Pitcairn with the hopes of spending a few hours on the island. This usually isn't successful as the ship has too many passengers on board. Although often the Pitcairners will go out to the cruise ship to sell them souvenirs. The cost and time involved with these cruises can be astronomical depending on the time on board, number of stops and of course class of service.</p>
