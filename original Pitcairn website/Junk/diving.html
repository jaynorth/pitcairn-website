<p>
If you are an experienced scuba diver, local Dive trips are available. In good weather and sea 
conditions you will have the opportunity to dive the wrecks of the HMAV Bounty and the Cornwallis and to also 
explore Pitcairn's deeper waters.  The pristine waters make this a delightful spot for discovering the marine life.
