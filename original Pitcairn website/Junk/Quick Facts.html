	The threshold of Pitcairn is a steep road, known as the 'Hill of Difficulty', running from Bounty Bay to the Edge.  This road, which follows the track used by the mutineers when they landed, rises upward for 70 metres hugging the side of the cliff.  As in the days of the mutineers all supplies must still be transported up this road, although tractors and motorbikes make the task less onerous today. 
The islanders live in and around Adamstown, the original home of the mutineers.  Adamstown is well situated on a northerly slope, 120 to 150 metres above sea level, and covers an area of 20 hectares.  From the Edge, the main road runs for about 800 metres through Adamstown, roughly parallel with the coastline.  The houses are scattered along the main road and side roads. 

<p>Along from the Edge, just past Big Fence and 'downside' the main road, is the Satellite Station, which houses the island's telecommunications system. </p>

<p>Further along the main road, the General Store is situated on the edge of the road.  The side road beside the general store leads down to the three public generators.  'Perkins', the main generator, is larger (100 kva) than the other older Lister generators which are 50 kva each.  The generators operate for five hours in the morning and five hours in the evening. 
</p>
<p>Continuing along the main road, The Square, 'upside' the road, is the heart of Pitcairn.  The Courthouse, with a veranda running along its entire length, takes up one side of the Square, and outside, on a plinth, stands Bounty's anchor, which was recovered by Yankee in 1957.  The hall serves as a meeting place for official meetings and as a focal point for social gatherings and public functions.  The internal walls are decorated with historical and official portraits and memorabilia. 
</p>
<p>Directly across the Square, from the Court House, is the Church.  The Bounty Bible, formerly stored in the church, is now in the new Museum
protected in its stand in a climatically controlled environment. </p>

<p>On the third side of the Square is a building containing the Island Secretary's Office, Library and Post Office and facing it, alongside the main road, is a long bench where people sit and wait for church or sit and idly gossip.  At both ends of the long bench there are two bells, which are rung on various occasions.  A series of strikes in ones and twos is the call for prayer; three strikes signifies public work; four strikes is the signal for a share-out of food from a passing ship (this is not common these days); and five strikes announces the arrival of a ship. 
</p>
<p>Before entering the Square, a walkway 'downside' the main road leads to the Health Centre.  The Health Centre, built in 1996, replaced the old dispensary at the Square. 
</p>
<p>Further down the main road is Bob's Valley, which by night smells of the strong, sweet scent of the Queen of the Night flower.  Just past Bob's Valley, is the road leading to the Mill (sugarcane mill), the island cemetery, The Lodge and  the Hostel.  During 1998 and 1999, the older hostels (built in 1968) underwent major refurbishment and significant improvements were made to the living quarters.  The hostels are magnificently situated under the shadow of Gannets Ridge and the yawning cave in which Fletcher Christian is reputed to have gone in solitude to survey his island. 
</p>
<p>Back on the main road, past the Banyan trees and Down Fence, the road leads out to Pulau where the School, Museum and the residence of the teacher are located.  Although not strictly speaking part of Adamstown, the school and School house sit below Christian's Cave and the track leading up to the cave can be found just below the school.
