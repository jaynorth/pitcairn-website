        <dd>The islands are inhabited by the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians  
        who accompanied them, an event retold in numerous books and films. This history is still apparent in the 
        surnames of many of the islanders. With only about 56 inhabitants, originating from four main families, Pitcairn
         is the least populous jurisdiction in the world.</dd>
      <dt id="geo">Geography</dt>
      <dd class="ddPleft"> Pitcairn Island, more than 2,200 km southeast of Tahiti, sits alone between Peru and New Zealand at 25° south latitude
        and 130° west longitude. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Mangareva, a small island in French Polynesia 490 km to the northwest.
        Easter Island lies 1,900 km to the east. <br />
        A high volcanic island, Pitcairn reaches 347 meters at the Pawala Ridge and is bounded by rocks and high cliffs on all sides. There's no
        coral reef, and breakers roll right in to the shore. </dd>
      <dd class="ddIMGright"> <img src="Images_mod/generalInfoContent_03.jpg" alt="map" width="400"   /> </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat"> The island is only 4.5 square km, almost half of which is fertile ground and
        well suited for human habitation.
        The uninhabited "nearby" islands of <strong>Henderson</strong>, <strong>Ducie</strong>, 
        and <strong>Oeno</strong> belong to Pitcairn. The tiny colony controls an exclusive 
        economic zone of 
        800,000 square km, an important reason why Britain is in no hurry to leave. </dd>

      </dd>
      <dd class="ddPright">The islands are each unique, with differing origins. <strong>Pitcairn</strong> is distinctly volcanic, 
        jutting steeply out of the ocean with a peak of 1106 ft, seemingly
        a stone's throw from the shoreline (in any direction). As such it has very little of what would be 
        called a "beach".
        However, the word "cliff" gets used a lot and harbours are hard to come by. 
        Bounty Bay hardly deserves the name, consisting of a small indentation in the shoreline with water 
        deep enough only for small boats without keels and a small sea-level landing area connected via 
        the <em>Hill of Difficulty</em> to <strong>Adamstown</strong>. It is the only island of the group with fresh water sources. 
      
     </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat">
        <p> Remote <strong>Henderson Island</strong>, UNESCO World Heritage site
          Henderson is by far the largest island with an area of more than 14 square miles (37.3 km²) - more than eight times 
          larger than Pitcairn but with a largely inaccessible interior. It's a flat coral formation, but raised 
          50-100 feet above sea level by volcanic activity. There are caves along its shoreline which served as either tombs 
          or ill-fated residences to an ancient people (remember: no fresh water). It might be suitable for building an airstrip 
          if it weren't for all the endangered seabirds that find it an ideal spot to land. <br />

      <dd class="ddPright"> <p>Pitcairn enjoys an warm maritime climate, with mean monthly temperatures varying from 19° C in August to 24° C 
        in February. Daily temperatures can vary from 13° C to 33° C. The 2,000 mm of annual rainfall is 
        unevenly distributed, and prolonged rainy periods alternate with droughts. Moderate easterly winds 
        predominate with short east-to-southeast gales occurring between April and September.
        In combination with the pleasant subtropical climate the conditions are very beneficial for plant and animal life on the fertile volcanic 
        soil. Because of low population figures the balance between man 
        and nature is excellent.</p> </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat"><p>The Pitcairn Islands are situated in a zone
        in the Pacific where hurricanes form. This means there is always a risk that a typhoon or tropical
        depression hits the islands.</p> </dd>
      <dt id="gettingthere">Getting There</dt>
      <dd class="ddPleft"><p> The Pitcairn Islands are only accessible via boat,<strong> The first option</strong> is booking a trip on the <strong>MV Claymore II</strong>, it runs about 3 times a year so make sure the timimg is ok.
        In making your way to Pitcairn you will first need to fly from your homeland to Tahiti. When you book these flights
        you'll also need to book Air Tahiti domestic flights from Tahiti to Gambier airport (situated on a coral atoll)
        just off <strong>Mangareva</strong>. When you exit the airport you will take a 35 minute ferry ride across to Rikitea 
        village and there, at the wharf you will find the Claymore II crew waiting for you. </p></dd>

      <dd class="resetFloat"><p> They will then transfer
        you and your luggage directly to the ship in their zodiac. They'll get you settled and you'll leave Mangareva for
        Pitcairn in the late afternoon. A couple of days later you'll arrive at Pitcairn. The Longboat will be 
        launched to pick you up and you'll soon be riding the waves into Bounty Bay.</p> </dd>
      <dd class="ddIMGleft"> <img src="Images_mod/generalInfoContent_14.jpg" alt=""   width="400" height="267" /><br />Ship's landing oint at Bounty Bay </dd>
      <dd class="ddPright"> <strong>The second option</strong> is via the SV Xplore which is a 20-meter long yacht with a capacity of 8 passengers on the boat. 
        The speed will be about 6-9 
        knots depending on the winds and weather. It will be bumpy but will also be relaxing 
        assuming decent weather and no seasickness. The cost including the expensive 4-hour flights 
        to and from Mangareva from Pape'ete, a hotel and transfers on each; plus room and board on Pitcairn 
        is about $4500 for a one-week trip (3 days on the island) and  $5000 for 2 weeks. 
        2 weeks includes 10 days on Pitcairn. </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat"> <strong> Third</strong>, a handful of trans-Pacific cruise ships will try to anchor off the coast 
        of Pitcairn with the hopes of spending a few hours on the island. 
        This usually isn't successful as the ship has too many passengers on board. 
        Although often the Pitcairners will go out to the cruise ship to sell them souvenirs. 
        The cost and time involved with these cruises can be astronomical depending on the 
        time on board, number of stops and of course class of service. </dd>

      <dt id="visa">Visa</dt>
      <dd>
        <p> Visitors staying on the island for <strong>any length of time</strong> require a license from the governor, 
          because the irregularity of transport means they're effectively residents of the island for 
          the next several weeks or even months. These licenses require proof of good health, the means 
          to leave at the end of the visit (e.g., passage on an upcoming ship), at least NZ$300/week to 
          cover your cost of living on Pitcairn, various other conditions, and a $100 fee; they are valid for six months. </p>
        <p> If your visit is for<strong> 14 days or less </strong> and you intend to arrive and depart on the same vessel, you may 
          apply for leave to enter on arrival at Pitcairn.  There is no need for prior entry clearance.  
          But you must ensure you can adequately maintain and accommodate yourself without recourse to public
          funds. </p>
        <p> If your visit is for<strong> longer than 14 days</strong> but <strong>less than 6 months</strong> you must 
          complete an entry clearance application form well in advance of your visit 
          (at least 3 months is recommended).  The application form should be submitted electronically 
          to the Pitcairn Immigration Officer on immigration@pitcairn.gov.pn and copied to the Pitcairn 
          Islands Office on admin@pitcairn.gov.pn.  If you do not get an acknowledgement 
          within 2 weeks, telephone on (649) 366 0186 to confirm your application has been received. </p>

      <dt id="language">Language</dt>
      <dd> There are two languages of Pitcairn Island, <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Pitkern</strong>.
        Pitkern is a creole language based on eighteenth-century English and Tahitian and spoken by about fifty people
        inland not to mention those outside Adamstown, mostly dozens of children leaving Pitcairn while becoming adults. 
        It is partly derived from eighteenth-century English because Pitcairn Island was settled by the Bounty mutineers
        in the eighteenth century, and they brought some people from Taihiti with them, the language was developed as a way for the English sailors and the Tahitians to communicate.
        Pitkern is closely related to Norfuk spoken on Norfolk Island, where some descendents of the mutineers subsequently settled. </dd>

The fertile soil of the Pitcairn valleys produces a 
wide variety of fruits: including bananas, papaya, pineapples, mangoes, watermelons, rockmelons, passionfruit, breadfruit, 
coconuts, avocadoes, and citrus; and vegetables include: sweet potatoes (kumura), carrots, sweet corn, 
tomatoes, taro, yams, peas, and beans. Pitcairn Island is remarkably productive and its benign climate allows a 
wide range of tropical and temperate crops to be grown.

</p>

<p>
Fish are plentiful in the seas around Pitcairn. Spiny lobster and a large variety of fish are caught for meals
 and for trading aboard passing ships. Almost every day someone will go fishing, whether it is from the rocks, from 
 a longboat or diving with a spear gun. 
</p> 


<p class="resetFloat">


The Pitcairners are involved in creating crafts and curios. Typical wood carvings
 include sharks, fish, whales, dolphins, turtles, vases, birds, walking sticks, book boxes and the famous models 
 of the Bounty.</p>

The major sources of revenue, until recently, have been the sale of <strong>coins</strong> and postage <strong>stamps</strong> to collectors, 
<strong>.pn domain names</strong>, and the sale of<strong> handicrafts</strong> to passing ships, most of which are plying the United Kingdom 
to New Zealand route via the Panama Canal. Trade is restricted by the jagged geography of the island, which 
lacks a harbour or airstrip, forcing all trade to be made by longboat to visiting ships.

 <!--<p>Occasionally, passengers 
from expedition-type cruise ships will come ashore for a day, weather permitting. Tourism is the main focus for 
building the future economy focusing on small groups coming by charter vessel and staying at "home stays". 
Providing accommodation is a growing source of revenue and some have invested in building separate self-contained 
units adjacent to their homes.</p> </dd>

<strong>Honey production</strong> on Pitcairn, it was discovered, has 
one of the best examples of disease-free bee populations anywhere in the world and the honey produced was and 
remains exceptionally high in quality. Pitcairn bees were also found to be a particularly placid variety and, 
within a short time, the beekeepers were able to work with them wearing minimal protection. As a result, Pitcairn 
today exports its renowned honey to New Zealand and to the United Kingdom. The honey has become a favourite of Queen Elizabeth II 
and Prince Charles.

<p>
<strong>Tourism</strong> plays a major role on Pitcairn, providing the locals 80% of their annual income. Since 2009, 
the Government has been operating the MV Claymore II as the island's only dedicated passenger cargo vessel 
providing tourists with adventure tourism holidays to Pitcairn for three- or ten-day visits. Tourists stay 
with local families and get to experience the island's history while contributing to the local economy. 
Some families have invested in private self-contained units for tourists to rent. Each year approximately 
ten cruise ships call at the island for a few hours, generating income for the locals from the sale of souvenirs, 
landing fees and the stamping of passports. 
</p>
</dd>

<p>
Electricity

Electricity on the island is provided by diesel generators operating ten hours per day 
(from 8 am to 1 pm, and from 5 pm to 10 pm).
