Under the shadow cast by Gannet's Ridge, is the yawning cave in which <strong>Fletcher Christian</strong>, leader of the mutiny on 
HMS Bounty is said to have spent many hours meditating and watching for ships.  Although it is now clearly 
visible from the sea, it was previously hidden by vines and lofty trees which would have afforded him a safe retreat.</p>

   <dd class="ddPright"><p><em> Of what thoughts ran through his mind during those solitary moments, one can but speculate.  
    Sometimes described as morose, did Christian spend his time reliving and regretting the act of mutiny which 
    ultimately condemned him, his followers and their offspring to a life of isolation?<br />  Did he, as some have suggested, 
    escape to the cave retreating from responsibility and the need to create some order within the society he 
    was so instrumental in bringing about?<br /> The truth is unlikely ever to be known.</em></p>

 <dd class="ddPleft"><p>Christians Cave is a dominant feature on the cliff face above Adamstown.  The triangular shape appears to be deeper 
  than it actually is because of the strong dark shadows on the cliff face.  Climbing up there is not for the faint hearted.
    From the cave you get a good view out over Adamstown and out to sea.  <br />

The track up to the cave starts from the end of the Eco Trail.  The tough strong grass that grows on the cliff face is 
called <em>"grab-a-leg"</em>.  The seed pods from this nasty little plant hook into your socks and shorts and any bare skin. 
The barbs are like little cactus needles.  Climbing up there brings a sense of achievement as you stand in the cave.  
The floor of the cave is flat and has a liberal covering of goat droppings all over it. 
As you climb up there you by-pass two smaller 'caves'.

 <dd class="resetFloat">
Of interest on the way is a tunnel that goes through the rock and gives a view up the valley.
You can climb through this tunnel safely.
Light fades quickly as 
  the sun sets behind Gannet's Ridge, so don't wait too long before heading back.
  

    Christian's Cave is a popular place to visit for tourists coming ashore from cruise ships and for 
    Pitcairners taking a Sabbath afternoon walk.  More a deep indentation in the cliffside, the cave 
    would afford little shelter from the elements.  The view across Adamstown and out over a 
    brillant blue sea however, is magnificent.
