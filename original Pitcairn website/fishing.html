      <dd id="fishingInfo">
        <p>The Island is surrounded by an exclusive economic zone of over 836,000 square kilometres, which hosts 
          one of the best-preserved marine ecosystems on the planet.
          
          With growing threats from industrial fishing and climate change, the Pitcairn islanders, together with the Pew Charitable 
          Trust Global Ocean Legacy, have been working on establishing a large scale marine reserve within their waters.</p>
        <p> In September 2012, the Pitcairn community, with Pew, National Geographic (both IUCN Members) and the Pitcairn Council, 
          presented a joint proposal to the UK government for the creation of the world's largest fully protected marine reserve. 
          The reserve would cover most of Pitcarin's exclusive economic zone and would exclude all forms of commercial extractive
          activity such as fishing, oil, gas and mineral mining but would allow for traditional subsistence fishing by Pitcairners.</p>
        <p> That being said, you can expect high quality fishing around the island and participate in this daily 
          traditional and vital activity enjoyed by the islanders, fish being the main source of nutrition on the island.</p>

      <dd class="ddPright">
        <p> <em><strong>There is no such thing as "catch and release‟ while 
          fishing in Pitcairn waters! If it gets caught…it gets 
          eaten!</strong> </em></p>
        <p> Those who might be worried about conserving fish 
          stocks can rest easy in the knowledge that Pitcairn 
          sea conditions prevent any possibility of over-fishing.<br />
          Long periods of strong wind and huge waves 
          buffeting the rocky shoreline not only prevent the 
          launching of the island fishing fleet, but also 
          drastically reduce the opportunity to throw a handline 
          into a sheltered pool near the tide line. </p>
      </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat">
        <p> Harvesting food from the sea has always been an 
          important part of the Pitcairn life-style. Fishhooks, 
          perhaps a thousand years old, fashioned from bone 
          or shells are on display in the island <a href="Adamstown.html#museum">museum</a>. <br />
          Middens and Marae are littered with small seashells, 
          indicating perhaps, that in times of shortage, even 
          the smallest morsel of food was gathered from the 
          sea. </p>
      </dd>
      <dd class="resetFloat"></dd>
      <dd class="ddPleft">
        <p> Quite recent history tells of times when not only did 
          the amount of food produced on land fluctuate from 
          year to year, but the harvest from the sea was not 
          very reliable either! <br />
          A very powerful storm released 
          such a deluge of rain that tonnes of mud and dirt slipped off the island and into the sea 
          surrounding Pitcairn Island. It took many years for the fish stocks to recover from the 
          smothering effects of the alluvial wash. <br />
          Changes to sea temperature might also be connected 
          to years of plenty followed by a period of shortage.</p>

      <dd class="resetFloat"> In the past, a bigger population of islanders 
        exerted much more pressure on the available fish, but of 
        course in those days the fishing canoe was powered by two 
        oars, not a thirty horsepower Yamaha, and the fish were 
        attracted by a piece of cloth or leaf, not a plastic "soft bait‟ 
        manufactured in Taiwan! </dd>

      <dd >
        <p> The modern fishing boat, found else where on the sea, relies 
          on a technologically advanced "flat screen fish finder‟, with 
          knobs and dials that produce depth, range and tonnage, all 
          at the press of a button; and in colour too, if that takes your 
          fancy! <br />
          But on Pitcairn, the men rely on a <strong>"fish-finder‟</strong> that is 
          covered in feathers and has a wingspan of a little over a 
          metre! <br />
          An umbrella of hungry sea birds always follows 
          small fish. Small fish are always followed by big fish. <br />
          Big 
          fish are always followed by fishermen! </p>
