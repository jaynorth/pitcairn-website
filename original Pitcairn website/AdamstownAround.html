     <dd>Raised from ocean's gloom, the anchor sees sunlight again. Irving Johnson volunteered to raise the relic. 
        With consummate seamanship he maneuvered the 96-foot-long Yankee through heavy swells into position directly 
        above the anchor. He then lowered his own Danforth anchor to waiting divers, who passed a wire loop from fluke 
        to fluke. Using her winch, Yankee then took a strain. The mass of iron trembled and shifted, but would not break 
        free from the sand.
        
        "I remembered," says Captain Johnson. "that my dentist, when pulling a tooth, yanks from several directions, so I 
        maneuvered the Yankee to take a strain alternately from each side."
        
        After 15 minutes of hauling and jockeying, the old anchor suddenly let go in a 
        cloud of sand.
        
        Here, as the hook emerges, divers make fast extra lines. </dd>
      <dd><img src="Images/27-raising-bountys-anchor-580v.jpg" alt="" width="410" /></dd>
      <dd>The salvaged 12-foot anchor rests on the landing in Bounty Bay. When it broke free from the bottom, most of the wooden stock remained buried and only the fragment shown at the feet of young Fletcher Christian was recovered.
        
        The anchor is the old Admiralty pattern, which was distinguished by straight-V flukes. Rounded flukes did not come into use until about 1810. The short length of chain attached to the ringbolt probably was used to make the anchor fast when it was raised to the cathead. </dd>

      <dd>a cliff on the southeast edge of the island, has ancient Polynesian petroglyphs in its face 
        and an isolated sandy beach at its base.
        
        At the end of the day, most every Pitcairner has been to Down Rope though, and there are surprisingly few stories of accidents. 
        The worst anyone can recall was just two years ago when a crew member on a visiting tall ship, the Picton Castle, fell nearly 
        half the way down, shattering his arm and breaking his back in three places. Within a month however he was nearly fully recovered, 
        dubbed by media accounts as "The Pitcairn Flying Miracle."
        
        When you finally make it to sea level, the natural beauty of the place would  bee enough to make it worth the trip. 
        Seeing the mysterious ancient Polynesian rock art petroglyphs makes you wonder who did it or why.
        Polynesians came to this island roughly 900 years ago, but also possibly thousands of years before that. Some of the images bear a 
        resemblance to other carvings on Easter Island or throughout the South Pacific, but we cannot ascribe definite meanings to any of them.
        
        Perhaps that is what makes rock art so captivating–like climbing the cliffs at Down Rope, it is unfamiliar, and leads to the unknown. 
        Traveling that way physically or mentally always makes for a memorable adventure. </dd>
